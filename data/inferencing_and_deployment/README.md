### ðŸ“‚ **`inferencing_and_deployment` Subfolder**

This subfolder contains three key files:

1. **`inferencing_code.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with the inferencing code used in the modeling process, along with the required libraries.
2. **`flask_app.py`**: Script for the application deployed using the Flask framework.
3. **`requirements.txt`**: A list of necessary packages to successfully run the Flask app.

**Note:**

ðŸ“Œ **Remember to:**
1. **Activate your virtual environment** before running the Flask app. Use the following command in your terminal to activate it:
   ```bash
   ./env/Scripts/activate
   ```
2. **Install all packages** from the `requirements.txt` file before running the app. Use the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Flask app** in your terminal using the command:
   ```bash
   python flask_app.py
   ```
