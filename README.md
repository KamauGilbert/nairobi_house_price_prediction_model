# 🏠 Nairobi Metropolitan House Price Prediction Problem

This project aims to answer the question:

**Project 6 of 11: Nairobi Metropolitan House Price Prediction with Python**  
📊 **Objective:** Predict house prices in the Nairobi Metropolitan area using machine learning and data analysis. The project involves building a predictive model based on house data.

### 🛠️ Tools, Frameworks, and Technologies:
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, Numpy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Web Frameworks:** Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit
- **APIs:** OpenAI APIs

### 🔍 **Project Overview:**
1. **Web Scraping:** Scrape relevant sites to gather house data.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze and visualize the data.
4. **Modeling:** Build and train the predictive models.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the model using a web framework.
6. **Chatbot Creation:** Develop a chatbot using OpenAI APIs that provides housing information in Kenya.
7. **Automation with Airflow (Optional):** Automate processes using Airflow.
8. **Write an Article:** Document the process and insights gained from the project.

💡 **Note:** You can use data scraped from Project 3 for this project.

This challenge was presented at the LUX hackathon held on Saturday, 20th July 2024, at Nation Centre.

### 🗂️ **Repository Structure:**
- **📁 data:** Main folder housing all other subfolders.
